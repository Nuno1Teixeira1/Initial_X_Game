##  About 
Initial X is a 2D top down view platform game made in Unity, inspired from Rally X. The player needs to collect a certain amount of flags (depending on the level) while avoiding the enemy cars, to advance to the next level. 
The player:
  - Starts with 3 lifes.
  - Has a power-up, which leaves behind a temporary block.
  - Updates the score, for each flag he gets.
